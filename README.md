# auto-install-scripts-for-coins
<p>For when i need to install a coin that i have installed before</p>
<p>just copy the code as a xxxxx.sh file on Ubuntu 16.04</p>
<p>then type:</p>
<p>bash xxxxx.sh</p> 
<p>press:</p>
<p>'enter'</p>
<p>the bash script will "apt update" and "apt upgrade" then install the required dependencies and compile the daemon</p>
<p>(depending on the coin, some sciprts also build the linux QT)</p>
