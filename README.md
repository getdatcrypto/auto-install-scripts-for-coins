# auto-install-scripts-for-coins
For when i need to install a coin that i have installed before
just copy the code as a xxxxx.sh file on Ubuntu 16.04
then type:
bash xxxxx.sh 
press:
'enter'
and the bash script will "apt update" and "apt upgrade" then install the required dependencies and compile the deamon and some instances even the linux QT
